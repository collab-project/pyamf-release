Description: AMF support for Python
 PyAMF provides Action Message Format (AMF) support for Python that is compatible with the Adobe 
 Flash Player. It includes integration with Python web frameworks like Pylons, Twisted, SQLAlchemy, 
 web2py and more.
 The Adobe Integrated Runtime and Adobe Flash Player use AMF to communicate between an application and a 
 remote server. AMF encodes remote procedure calls (RPC) into a compact binary representation that can be 
 transferred over HTTP/HTTPS or the RTMP/RTMPS protocol. Objects and data values are serialized into this 
 binary format, which increases performance, allowing applications to load data up to 10 times faster than 
 with text-based formats such as XML or SOAP.
 AMF3, the default serialization for ActionScript 3.0, provides various advantages over AMF0, which is used 
 for ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0. AMF3 sends data over the network more efficiently than AMF0. AMF3 supports 
 sending int and uint objects as integers and supports data types that are available only in ActionScript 
 3.0, such as ByteArray, ArrayCollection, ObjectProxy and IExternalizable.
